--
-- == Description
--
-- This device extension allows registration of device memory event
-- callbacks upon device creation, so that applications or middleware can
-- obtain detailed information about memory usage and how memory is
-- associated with Vulkan objects. This extension exposes the actual
-- underlying device memory usage, including allocations that are not
-- normally visible to the application, such as memory consumed by
-- 'Vulkan.Core10.Pipeline.createGraphicsPipelines'. It is intended
-- primarily for use by debug tooling rather than for production
-- applications.
--
-- == New Structures
--
-- -   'DeviceMemoryReportCallbackDataEXT'
--
-- -   Extending 'Vulkan.Core10.Device.DeviceCreateInfo':
--
--     -   'DeviceDeviceMemoryReportCreateInfoEXT'
--
-- -   Extending
--     'Vulkan.Core11.Promoted_From_VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2.PhysicalDeviceFeatures2',
--     'Vulkan.Core10.Device.DeviceCreateInfo':
--
--     -   'PhysicalDeviceDeviceMemoryReportFeaturesEXT'
--
-- == New Function Pointers
--
-- -   'PFN_vkDeviceMemoryReportCallbackEXT'
--
-- == New Enums
--

--
-- == New Enum Constants
--
-- -   'EXT_DEVICE_MEMORY_REPORT_EXTENSION_NAME'
--
-- -   'EXT_DEVICE_MEMORY_REPORT_SPEC_VERSION'
--
-- -   Extending 'Vulkan.Core10.Enums.StructureType.StructureType':
--
--     -   'Vulkan.Core10.Enums.StructureType.STRUCTURE_TYPE_DEVICE_DEVICE_MEMORY_REPORT_CREATE_INFO_EXT'
--
--     -   'Vulkan.Core10.Enums.StructureType.STRUCTURE_TYPE_DEVICE_MEMORY_REPORT_CALLBACK_DATA_EXT'
--
--     -   'Vulkan.Core10.Enums.StructureType.STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_DEVICE_MEMORY_REPORT_FEATURES_EXT'
--
-- == Issues
--
-- 1) Should this be better expressed as an extension to VK_EXT_debug_utils
-- and its general-purpose messenger construct?
--
-- __RESOLVED__: No. The intended lifecycle is quite different. We want to
-- make this extension tied to the device’s lifecycle. Each ICD just
-- handles its own implementation of this extension, and this extension
-- will only be directly exposed from the ICD. So we can avoid the extra
-- implementation complexity used to accommodate the flexibility of
-- @VK_EXT_debug_utils@ extension.
--
-- 2) Can we extend and use the existing internal allocation callbacks
-- instead of adding the new callback structure in this extension?
--
-- __RESOLVED__: No. Our memory reporting layer that combines this
-- information with other memory information it collects directly (e.g.
-- bindings of resources to 'Vulkan.Core10.Handles.DeviceMemory') would
-- have to intercept all entry points that take a
-- 'Vulkan.Core10.AllocationCallbacks.AllocationCallbacks' parameter and
-- inject its own @pfnInternalAllocation@ and @pfnInternalFree@. That may
-- be doable for the extensions we know about, but not for ones we do not.
-- The proposal would work fine in the face of most unknown extensions. But
-- even for ones we know about, since apps can provide a different set of
-- callbacks and userdata and those can be retained by the driver and used
-- later (esp. for pool object, but not just those), we would have to
-- dynamically allocate the interception trampoline every time. That is
-- getting to be an unreasonably large amount of complexity and (possibly)
-- overhead.
--
-- We are interested in both alloc\/free and import\/unimport. The latter
-- is fairly important for tracking (and avoiding double-counting) of
-- swapchain images (still true with “native swapchains” based on external
-- memory) and media\/camera interop. Though we might be able to handle
-- this with additional
-- 'Vulkan.Core10.Enums.InternalAllocationType.InternalAllocationType'
-- values, for import\/export we do want to be able to tie this to the
-- external resource, which is one thing that the @memoryObjectId@ is for.
--
-- The internal alloc\/free callbacks are not extensible except via new
-- 'Vulkan.Core10.Enums.InternalAllocationType.InternalAllocationType'
-- values. The 'DeviceMemoryReportCallbackDataEXT' in this extension is
-- extensible. That was deliberate: there is a real possibility we will
-- want to get extra information in the future. As one example, currently
-- this reports only physical allocations, but we believe there are
-- interesting cases for tracking how populated that VA region is.
--
-- The callbacks are clearly specified as only callable within the context
-- of a call from the app into Vulkan. We believe there are some cases
-- where drivers can allocate device memory asynchronously. This was one of
-- the sticky issues that derailed the internal device memory allocation
-- reporting design (which is essentially what this extension is trying to
-- do) leading up to 1.0.
--
-- 'Vulkan.Core10.AllocationCallbacks.AllocationCallbacks' is described in
-- a section called “Host memory” and the intro to it is very explicitly
-- about host memory. The other callbacks are all inherently about host
-- memory. But this extension is very focused on device memory.
--
-- 3) Should the callback be reporting which heap is used?
--
-- __RESOLVED__: Yes. It is important for non-UMA systems to have all the
-- device memory allocations attributed to the corresponding device memory
-- heaps. For internally-allocated device memory, @heapIndex@ will always
-- correspond to an advertised heap, rather than having a magic value
-- indicating a non-advertised heap. Drivers can advertise heaps that do
-- not have any corresponding memory types if they need to.
--
-- 4) Should we use an array of callback for the layers to intercept
-- instead of chaining multiple of the
-- 'DeviceDeviceMemoryReportCreateInfoEXT' structures in the @pNext@ of
-- 'Vulkan.Core10.Device.DeviceCreateInfo'?
--
-- __RESOLVED__ No. The pointer to the
-- 'DeviceDeviceMemoryReportCreateInfoEXT' structure itself is const and
-- you cannot just cast it away. Thus we cannot update the callback array
-- inside the structure. In addition, we cannot drop this @pNext@ chain
-- either, so making a copy of this whole structure does not work either.
--
-- 5) Should we track bulk allocations shared among multiple objects?
--
-- __RESOLVED__ No. Take the shader heap as an example. Some
-- implementations will let multiple 'Vulkan.Core10.Handles.Pipeline'
-- objects share the same shader heap. We are not asking the implementation
-- to report 'Vulkan.Core10.Enums.ObjectType.OBJECT_TYPE_PIPELINE' along
-- with a 'Vulkan.Core10.APIConstants.NULL_HANDLE' for this bulk
-- allocation. Instead, this bulk allocation is considered as a layer below
-- what this extension is interested in. Later, when the actual
-- 'Vulkan.Core10.Handles.Pipeline' objects are created by suballocating
-- from the bulk allocation, we ask the implementation to report the valid
-- handles of the 'Vulkan.Core10.Handles.Pipeline' objects along with the
-- actual suballocated sizes and different @memoryObjectId@.
--
-- 6) Can we require the callbacks to be always called in the same thread
-- with the Vulkan commands?
--
-- __RESOLVED__ No. Some implementations might choose to multiplex work
-- from multiple application threads into a single backend thread and
-- perform JIT allocations as a part of that flow. Since this behavior is
-- theoretically legit, we cannot require the callbacks to be always called
-- in the same thread with the Vulkan commands, and the note is to remind
-- the applications to handle this case properly.
--
-- 7) Should we add an additional “allocation failed” event type with
-- things like size and heap index reported?
--
-- __RESOLVED__ Yes. This fits in well with the callback infrastructure
-- added in this extension, and implementation touches the same code and
-- has the same overheads as the rest of the extension. It could help
-- debugging things like getting an
-- 'Vulkan.Core10.Enums.Result.ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY' error when ending
-- a command buffer. Right now the allocation failure could have happened
-- anywhere during recording, and a callback would be really useful to
-- understand where and why.

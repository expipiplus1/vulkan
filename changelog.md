## [3.4] - 2020-06-03
  - Bump API version to 1.2.142
    - The spec includes specific locations for types, so we use them
    - BaseType -> FundamentalTypes
  - Add `withSomeStruct` helper

## [3.3.1] - 2020-05-18
  - Bump API version to 1.2.141
  - Generate haddocks for command parameters, #92
  - Eq instances for some simple structs, #94
  - Generate safe FFI versions of blocking functions (Those with "wait" in the
    name or which can return "TIMEOUT"), #96
  - Add cabal flag for enable deriving Generic for structs, #99
  - Add `complete` pragmas for `::&` and `:&`

## [3.3] - 2020-05-07
  - Move package from `Graphics.Vulkan` to just `Vulkan`, #60
  - Bump API version to 1.2.140
  - Make the continuation the last argument to 'bracket' functions, discussion
    on #49
  - Begin/End bracket pairs are now called 'useXXX' rather than 'withXXX', #66
  - Begin/End bracket pairs where it's not necessary to 'End' on an exception
    have a simplified type, discussion on #49
  - Clarify optional vector lengths by preserving the length member, #71
  - Infer lengths of preserved length members when they are 0
  - Throw an exception when trying to call a null function pointer, #42
  - Implement HasObjectType class to automate getting VkObjectType, #54
  - Add constraints to check that structs are correctly extended
  - Simplify type of `withDescriptorSets`, it no longer requires the user
    specifying the `DescriptorPool` twice, #81
  - Wrap with SomeStruct extensible structs in Vector arguments to commands, #82

  Thanks to @dpwiz for helping with this release!

## [3.2.0.0] - 2020-05-02
  - Update API version 1.2.139
  - Bracket functions now take as an argument a function to consume a pair of

    constrained to be the length of another known vector
  - Move `Counter` prefix on `PerformanceCounterResult` to be a suffix
  - Drop dependency on `vector-sized`, it was only used internally
